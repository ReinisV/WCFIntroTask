### Archivation note [START]
I wrote the stuff in this repository while teaching the basic concepts of C# programming and WCF services specifically at Accenture Bootcamp.

This code is the beginning boilerplate meant as a starting point for the students to use during class. The students are then supposed to setup a WCF service that allows communication between `CatsDataAccess` and `WCFClientConsoleApp` through a WCF service without the Console app talking to the library directly.

Since the course has ended (and WCF is very much dead), I don't plan on adding anything to it.

# WCFIntroTask

This repo is a task to introduce developers to WCF. The task is to create a WCF library, which would allow The ConsoleApp and the DataAccess library communicate without directly talking to each other but through a WCF service
